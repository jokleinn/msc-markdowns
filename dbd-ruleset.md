# DBD Ruleset 
This looks more complex than it really is. The gist: Everything's allowed, 
but there are penalties for using stuff that isn't fun, and bonuses for being a victim of stuff that isn't fun.
The rules that are listed are unlikely to apply to anybody that is playing in a way that is fun to play against,
and as a result these are only rules listed so that there are penalties on paper for not being very nice to your friends.

# Da Rules

## Being Nice <a name="beingnice"></a>
### Post-game <a name="postgame"></a>
This is at the top so that it is not glossed over.
Being loudly or violently rude/mean to somebody after a match for their gameplay when they did not break any of the listed rules is grounds for exclusion from the following trial.
Voicing disagreement or distaste for something in a civil or impersonal manner does not constitute a violation of this rule.
> Saying "This fucking sucks to play against" is okay.

> Saying "That whole thing was obnoxious" is a non-derogatory manner is okay.

> Saying "Can we ban X thing?" is okay.

> Saying "You're doing X thing because you suck" in a non-joking manner is not.

> Saying "You always do X thing because you suck" in a non-joking manner is not.
### Camping (\<16m from hook) <a name="camping"></a>
Hooking a survivor and then standing so close to them that they cannot easily be saved *when other survivors are doing generators
**or** all generators are done and the end game collapse has not yet started* is not fun to play with or against. Doing so disqualifies the offending player from playing killer again until everybody else has been nominated for killer at least **twice**.
> It is possible under this rule to camp a survivor if there is good reason 
> to believe that there are survivors waiting close by to dehook the hooked survivor.

> It is also possible under this rule to hook a survivor, go to an exit gate and open the exit gate 
> (killers are able do that if the gates are powered, meaning all 5 generators are completed),
> and return to the hook and stand guard over the survivor. This likely means
> that any other survivors will be able to escape through the door that the killer has opened,
> thereby taking potential hooks and kills away from the killer, which is why it is considered fair play.
### Trapping the Exit Gates during EGC <a name="trappingegc"></a>
Trapping or blocking the exit gates in such a way that survivor cannot open an exit gate without immediately giving the killer information about their whereabouts is not fun to play against. When the End Game Collapse has begun (hatch is kicked), if a survivor has no means of escaping through the exit gates without a certainty of dying then the killer is at fault of violating this rule and will be disqualified from playing killer again until everybody else has been nominated for killer at least **twice**.

## Allowed features <a name="allowedfeatures"></a>
**All** items, addons, perks, and killers are allowed. Discouragement of tactics that are
not usually fun to play against is provided by the **Score Adjustments** section.
However, there exist two "bans" per lobby -- one is the killer's choice, and one is the choice of all 4 survivors.
Of course, players may choose not to vote or veto anything, but there is no compensation for not voting or vetoing.
### Dynamic Bans <a name="bans"></a>
#### Players' Choice
##### Killer Veto <a name="veto"></a>
The killer may veto *exactly one* perk, offering, item *class*, or survivor character.
They must type their veto in the chat or discuss it out loud with the survivors before readying up.
> The item class bans allow killers to say "no toolboxes" or "no medkits,"
> but the perk, offering, and survivor character bans are precise choices. Killers may say
> "no Distortion," but they may not say "No exhaustion perks."
**The killer may veto the survivors' ban; in doing so, they forfeit their own ban.**
###### List of item classes <a name="itemclasses"></a>
* Flashlights
* Toolboxes
* Firecrackers
* Medkits
* Maps
* Keys
##### Survivor Vote <a name="vote"></a>
The survivors may vote together to ban *exactly one* perk, offering, killer character, or addon *class*.
They should agree on their ban together out loud before one types it in chat or communicates it to the killer out loud in order
to avoid confusion. This must be done before all four survivors have readied up.
> The addon *class* bans allow survivors to say "no tracking addons," for example.
> Because the survivors do not know who the killer is, it is very difficult to ban a specific type of addon and meaningfully affect
> the killer. As a result, very broad addon classes are defined for killers' powers.
**The survivors may vote to disable the killer's ban; in doing so, they forfeit their own ban.**
###### List of addon classes <a name="addonclasses"></a>
* Pinks
* Information (auras, noise notifications)
* Lasting debuffs (mangled, hemorrhage)
* Chase debuffs (hindered, exhausted)
* Stealth (terror radius, crouch speed, sound modifications etc)
* Cooldown (exception: non-cooldown power bar build speed)
* Duration
#### Consequences for Breaches <a name="consequences"></a>
##### By Accident <a name="byaccident"></a>
Players who *accidentally* do not honor a ban that is placed suffer no penalty; however, the trial must be restarted without using
whatever was banned. If the trial is entirely completed without anybody noticing the ban was not honored, the trial does not have to be restarted.
##### Intentional <a name="intentional"></a>
Players who *intentionally* do not honor a ban that is placed are excluded from the next trial. The ongoing trial must be ended.
If the trial is entirely completed without anybody noticing, the party (survivors, or the killer) who placed the ban may choose
whether or not to exclude the offending player from the next trial.



## Scoring Rules & Determining Roles <a name="scoringrules"></a>

### The random-roll pool <a name="randomroll"></a>
[RANDOM.ORG's list randomizer](https://random.org/lists/) is used to determine the killer, 
and the first exclusions (if any). The list of players is typed in; the player at position 1 after randomization is
nominated to be the killer, and the players with positions 2 through 5 are nominated to be survivors. Any other players in the
list are excluded. Excluded players who choose to spectate the match and provide information 
to the killer or survivors that they couldn't otherwise see (e.g. switching to killer view while talking to the survivors
about where the killer is) will be excluded from subsequent matches and should be BM'ed for being jerks.

### Minimum Score <a name="minscore"></a>
#### Killer <a name="minscore-killer"></a>
Killers must score a minimum of **12,500** bloodpoints to be eligible to play killer again.
Players who are excluded from the pool in this manner become eligible again
after all other eligible players have been selected at least once.
Players who are excluded from the pool may be nominated to be re-added to the pool by the killer that comes 
immediately after them, provided the killer after them can score the minimum **PLUS** the previous killer's deficit.
> This means that if a killer scores 10,500 bloodpoints, and the killer immediately after them scores at least 14,500 bloodpoints,
> that player may nominate the previous killer to be re-added to the pool.
#### Survivor <a name="minscore-survivor"></a>
When more than 5 players are present, survivors must score a minimum of **7,500** bloodpoints
in order to be included in the next random-roll pool. If exclusions would reduce the number of players below 5,
the highest-scoring excluded survivors will be added to round the player count off.
### Repeating turns <a name="repeatingturns"></a>
#### Killer <a name="repeatingturns-killer"></a>
A killer who scores a minimum of **30,000** bloodpoints is allowed to appoint the next killer, *including themself*. 
However, *a player may not use this method to be killer more than twice in a row.*
#### Survivor <a name="repeatingturns-survivor"></a>
A survivor who scores a minimum of **30,000** bloodpoints is allowed to choose the *killer character* of the next killer, as 
long as the next killer owns that killer, but they cannot choose the next killer. 
*Survivors may not use this method to compel a player to play something that will get them penalized -- if playing Plague 
gets the killer a penalty, then survivors may not tell the next killer to play the Plague!*


### Score Adjustments <a name="score-adjustments"></a>

#### The Pink Tax <a name="pinktax"></a>
Equipping *and making use of* a pink addon or item reduces your effective score by **5,000** bloodpoints *per pink*. 

#### Instadowns <a name="instadowns"></a>
Equipping *and making use of* an instadown addon (something that says "...inflicts **dying** upon the victim") 
*on a killer that does not already have an instadown feature* reduces the killer's effective score by **5,000** bloodpoints.
**Exposure perks are fair game -- they are all situational and counterable**.
> If an instadown addon is also a pink addon, the penalties do not stack linearly -- a single pink instadown addon is only 
> a 7,500 bloodpoint loss, not a 10,000 bloodpoint loss.

#### Memento Mori and Similar <a name="moris"></a>
##### Killer
Using a perk, addon, or offering to outright kill a survivor before they have been hooked twice reduces your effective
score by **2,500** bloodpoints. Survivors that are killed after being hooked twice cause no penalty to the killer.
##### Survivor
Being a victim of a perk, addon, or offering that outright kills the survivor will increase the survivor's effective score by **2,500** bloodpoints.
Being killed unfairly (before being hooked twice) will increase the survivor's effective score by an additional **2,500** bloodpoints.

#### \#NoCounterplay <a name="nocounterplay"></a>
Playstlyes listed in this category are penalized because there is nothing that other players can do about the playstyle, and
most, if not all, are only upgrades for the offending user, rather than being sidegrades.
##### Killers <a name="nocounterplay-killer"></a>
###### Exhaustion Addons <a name="exhaustion"></a>
Exhaustion addons allow killers to entirely remove a survivor's ability to use a *playstyle-altering* perk in their loadout,
and often don't even require much effort to apply to a survivor. Using an exhaustion addon will reduce the killer's effective
score by **2,500** bloodpoints *per 30 seconds of exhaustion that the addon provides*.
###### Plague <a name="plague"></a>
The plague forces survivors to either spend the entire game in the broken state, or face the wrath of her blood flamethrower.
In addition, she has addons that can make her the second-best tracker in the game (second only to the doctor), or start the game
with her blood flamethrower available. As a result, she has the hypothetical capacity to down all four survivors without even hitting them
by using a single right-mouse press almost immediately from the start of the game. She isn't fun to play against, and she's extremely
strong below red ranks. Playing the plague will reduce the killer's effective score by **15,000** bloodpoints.
###### Spirit (Specific Addons) <a name="spirit"></a>
The Spirit's passive phasing allows her to completely avoid being looped by survivors who pay attention to the killer's body
because she disappears from the map entirely from the survivors' point of view, while still very much being able to act from
her point of view. Any addons that increase the frequency or duration of passive phasing will reduce the killer's effective score
by **2,500** bloodpoints *per offending addon*.
###### Hillbilly & Bubba (Specific Addons) <a name="hillbilly"></a>
The Chainsaw Enthusiasts' Carburetor Tuning Guide (CTG) and Primer Bulb addons allow them to very quickly chainsaw a survivor, giving them very little
opportunity to juke and survive. Either of these addons being equipped will reduce the killer's effective score by **2,500** bloodpoints *per offending addon*.
##### Survivors <a name="nocounterplay-survivor"></a>
###### Rock Bug / Holding the Game Hostage <a name="rockbug"></a>
There is literally *zero* counterplay to the "rock bug". The bug involves getting on top a rock that generates on some maps,
such that a killer is unable to hit the survivor or get on top of the rock themself. The game can be held hostage by doing this.
Survivors who abuse the rock bug will **be excluded** from the following trial.

#### \#MeToo <a name="metoo"></a>
This category is for the list of things that have counterplay even below red ranks, but are still not fun to play against.
##### Killers
###### Doctor <a name="doctor"></a>
The Doctor's most popular perk build is designed to make skill checks very difficult to hit, which is very punishing for new players.
Playing The Doctor with perks or addons that affect skill checks will reduce the killer's effective score by **2,500** bloodpoints *per offending addon or perk*.
###### Nurse <a name="nurse"></a>
The Nurse has an insane amount of mobility and chase potential, even after her nerf. In the right hands, she is unstoppable; 
she completely ignores pallets, vaults, walls, and cries for mercy. Playing the nurse **well** will reduce the killer's effective
score by **15,000** bloodpoints.
> People learning how to play the Nurse are excluded from this rule.
